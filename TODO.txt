Additional algorithms.

click and select node.
	-fix bug that selecting sometimes doesn't work (I think there is a bug in the indexing or possibly the scaling breaks things)
	
	-implement the rotation selecting.


unify the different axis systems used in the program (e.g. newickTreeIndex, TreeNode etc).

Replace Point2 and Point3 with propper classes, preferably the glm::vec2 and glm::vec3

Rewrite some application.cpp code (the selecting part)

Replace the SpacereclaimingIciclePlot functions with reference functions, also; clean up the whole file.
	-Memory leak icicle plots -> create destructor.

Clean up application.cpp, more OOP
